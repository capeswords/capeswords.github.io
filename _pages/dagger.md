## Norling Workshop

### Digression: Dagger Grips

Types:

* Grip 1: Blade up, next to thumb. *not used often*
* Grip 2: Blade down, away from thumb
* Grip 3: on the blade just blow the hilt 

```
emphasis: where the dagger and sword would be placed on your body.
	* Dagger behind the back, for right hand to access
	* sword on left hip
```

### Dagger guards, basics:

Right leg forward, dagger in right hand with blade pointing opposite to the thumb (down), 
	
* *oberhut*: raised so that the point is to the opponent's head. Think boar's tooth.
* *middenhut*: lower the hand so it is by your side
* *unterhut*: cross blade to left hip, point facing to the opponent
* *kreutzhut*: right hand in front of chest, left hand just behind the right, dagger protecting the fore arm.

Create a cutting pattern from right to left and left to right, going through the guards

```
emphasis: on constantly shifting between positions, 
emphasis: moving about looking for position, using GOOD footwork
emphasis: on staff foot work
emphasis: shifting weight back and forth
emphasis: aim at the opponent!
```

**activity D1**: go into groups of four or more and face off against each other, using foot work and changing guards and switching opponents. Must move relative to each other. Calm. Focus on getting the pattern right.

### Digression: Dagger play

Aim is to demonstrate potential uses.

* A stabs at B from top right, B starting from [middenhut, unterhut, curthut] puts dagger on A's dagger hand wrist to stop attack in a punching attack, can then use dagger to capture wrist, etc. 

### Dagger 1 v 1 Aggression

**activity D2**: Same as activity D1. This time 1v1. Be agressive! move between guards faster.

```
emphasis: move back and forth and side to side.
```

### Dagger parry with dagger:

* types:
	- clap your hands. *emphasis: thumb up, in the after*
	- breast stroke. *emphasis: thumb down, lead with the meat of the palm in the before*

**activity D3**: 1v1 Dagger dance with each other, then one person attacks, the other parries. Switch. 

```
emphasis: MOVE
emphasis: Be careful, and controlled
```

### Ghost Dagger: Dagger cut, parry, counter attack without dagger:

_Key_: Look for where the opponent is open. Look to the flank, head, arm, elbow

**activity D4**: do activity D3, once you have successfully parried, counter attack at where the opponent is open. Then Switch. Can do this slower so that you can figure out where they are open and where to attack. Speed up as you get used to it.

```
emphasis: just touch, dont hit
emphasis: keep the dance going
emphasis: try to use both hands and directions for the parries
```
