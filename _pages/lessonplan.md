### Legend

Key for terms used in the notes:

* **EP** - End play. _A temporary place to stop the play to let the students try out the play before continuing._
* *[]* - pick one in this list
* *()* - perform in order

## Foot Work 

#### Group of 3 or 4, one in the center

**activity F1**: One person in the middle, opponents on the outside. Inside man moves aggressively to one of the outside people then switches targets. outside people emphasis is to get into the back of the guy in the middle. Position so can attack from directly behind thier back.

#### Foot stomper

**activity F2**: 2 people pair up, tap each others foot.

```
emphasis: do not stomp
```

#### Basics on movement

```
emphasis: skills of good footwork are balance, coordination, precision, stability, changing direction
```

**Advance**: basic fencing step forward

**Passing**:	low, keeping hips at same height, move forward. heel toe landing

**Cross**: show, side you wish to move to leads. 

```
emphasis: changing line
```

**Moving side to side**: show, side you wish to move to leads.

```
emphasis: Heel toe. Sports fencing foot work is key
emphasis: LOWER!
emphasis: leading toe always, ALWAYS, must be pointing toward the enemy.
emphasis: back straight up!
```

**activity F3**: teacher leads, class follows, make them follow advance, passing, cross, side to side.

#### Tag Game

**activity F4**: One person is hunter. They nominate a person to be the prey. The hunter must try touch the prey. Once the prey is touched they become the hunter.

**rule**: If anyone crosses the line in between the prey and the hunter, that person becomes the new prey. 
emphasis: other people must try cross the line 

#### Head Knee game

**activity F5**: 1v1, barehanded. A goes for B's head, B goes for A's knee. Once anyone succeeds, switch.
emphasis: lightly touch target.

**variant**: both A and B target the knee.

#### Superman punch

**activity F6**: A holds hand out at punch distance, B then punches hand while twisting hips and shoulders 90 degrees.

*Follow on*: Do punch, with twist, then only once full extenstion take a step forward, heel toe

*Follow on*: Perform step without a punch

```
emphasis: twist front foot out to the outside rotating on the front of the foot
emphasis: rear foot raise the ankle
emphasis: hand is by cheek and stays at the same height straight forward
```

## Dagger

#### Sources

```

#### Digression: Dagger Grips

Types:

* Grip 1: Blade up, next to thumb. *not used often*
* Grip 2: Blade down, away from thumb
* Grip 3: on the blade just blow the hilt 

```
emphasis: where the dagger and sword would be placed on your body.
	* Dagger behind the back, for right hand to access
	* sword on left hip
```

#### Dagger guards, basics:

Right leg forward, dagger in right hand with blade pointing opposite to the thumb (down), 
	
* *oberhut*: raised so that the point is to the opponent's head. Think boar's tooth.
* *middenhut*: lower the hand so it is by your side
* *unterhut*: cross blade to left hip, point facing to the opponent
* *kreutzhut*: right hand in front of chest, left hand just behind the right, dagger protecting the fore arm.

Create a cutting pattern from right to left and left to right, going through the guards

```
emphasis: on constantly shifting between positions, 
emphasis: moving about looking for position, using GOOD footwork
emphasis: on staff foot work
emphasis: shifting weight back and forth
emphasis: aim at the opponent!
```

**activity D1**: go into groups of four or more and face off against each other, using foot work and changing guards and switching opponents. Must move relative to each other. Calm. Focus on getting the pattern right.

#### Digression: Dagger play

Aim is to demonstrate potential uses.

* A stabs at B from top right, B starting from [middenhut, unterhut, curthut] puts dagger on A's dagger hand wrist to stop attack in a punching attack, can then use dagger to capture wrist, etc. 

#### Dagger 1 v 1 Aggression

**activity D2**: Same as activity D1. This time 1v1. Be agressive! move between guards faster.

```
emphasis: move back and forth and side to side.
```

#### Dagger parry with dagger:

* types:
	- clap your hands. *emphasis: thumb up, in the after*
	- breast stroke. *emphasis: thumb down, lead with the meat of the palm in the before*

**activity D3**: 1v1 Dagger dance with each other, then one person attacks, the other parries. Switch. 

```
emphasis: MOVE
emphasis: Be careful, and controlled
```

#### Ghost Dagger: Dagger cut, parry, counter attack without dagger:

_Key_: Look for where the opponent is open. Look to the flank, head, arm, elbow

**activity D4**: do activity D3, once you have successfully parried, counter attack at where the opponent is open. Then Switch. Can do this slower so that you can figure out where they are open and where to attack. Speed up as you get used to it.

```
emphasis: just touch, dont hit
emphasis: keep the dance going
emphasis: try to use both hands and directions for the parries
```

#### Dagger play cut, parry, counter with dagger

**activity D5**: Right handed stabs, A and B start in oberhut, A stabs at B from oberhut, B stabs over A's arm from oberhut whilst B steps out and changes line, then B presses his arm out to his outside and stabs A in the flank. This looks like B is swinging his arm out.

**activity D6**: Right handed stabs, A, B start in oberhut, A stabs at B, B punches up at A's wrist (aiming to get the blade on the wrist) with a straight arm and the blade to the right, B then reverses blade so it is on A's outside and the tip points up (on the outside of B's arm), B then wraps the blade over A's arm and pulls down to the right, grip down, finally B pommels A

**activity D7**: Left handed stabs. repeat D5, D6 from stabbing from the left. Workshop

## Dussack

###### Sources

```
Roger Norling Blade workshop: IMG_4196.MOV - 
Joachim Meyer - The Art of Combat, Book 2
```

### General approach to Dussack

1. Do not wait in the guards. Aim to attack as quickly as possible in the Before. As it is isn't always possible to be first, always make sure to place yourself in a posture/position/guard such that the opponent can not attack you without incurring damage to himself.

2. All attacks are a flow from one guard to another.

3. Learn the guards and the attacks from those guards, so as to learn what techniques and attacks are possible from the opponent. From this you can deduce the opponents strategy.

4. Given you can deduce his strategy from a guard, never remain static in a guard. Always change, look for position/advantage. This hides your intent and adds to the challenge of attacking you.

### How to hold the Dussack

1. Normal Hammer Grip. 

2. Extended Thumb grip. Place the thumb of the sword hand along the back of the handle. This should add to better control.

3. Side Grip. Thumb by the nargel

### Stances

This is a brief summary of the available stances/postures.

```
emphasis: these are NOT stationary guards, keep moving between them
emphasis: DO NOT stand still in these guards
emphasis: it is all in the movements
```

* *wacht*: right foot forward, both hands above the head, right arm infront of left, dussack pointing backwards
* *schnitt*: right arm forward and slightly bent, blade held forward with the blade pointing to the head of opponent, blade facing as per cut from above head
* *langort*: blade point directly at opponent, at the longest extention of the sword tip to enemy.
* *bastey*: blade pointing 45 degrees down to the ground, towards the opponent
* *wechselhut*: blade pointing down to the ground, blade edge away from opponent, perpendicular
* *nebenhut*: wechselhut with blade edge to opponent. blade pointing to the ground 45 degrees away from the opponent

**Cut 1**: (wacht, schnitt, langort, bastey, wechselhut, nebenhut) on [left, right] side of the body. looks like a J. 

* *bogen*: cut forward to schnitt from wacht, then rotate wrist [left, right] so blade is pointing down. (can point anywhere from 45 degrees down to straight down) 
* *einhorn*: blade facing the left side pointing upwards at 45 degrees, right hand by face. #ThurstingGuard
* *stier*: einhorn but with point to opponent, blade edge up, and left hand behind the blade to support it. #ThurstingGuard
* *eber*: right hand by right hip, blade parallel to floor point at oppoenent, left hand protecting the heart. #ThurstingGuard
* *zornhut*: left foot forward, lean back away from opponent onto the right foot, blade on the back by right shoulder. #ThurstingGuard
* *middenhut*: [right side]:left foot forward, weight on right, hand at shoulder height, blade hanging. reverse for left side.

To Thrust: go from a #ThurstingGuard to langort

**Cut 2**: (right middenhut, schnitt, left middenhut, bastey)

**activity U1**: while facing an opponent move between the guards, constantly changing and repositioning. Similar to D2.

### The Primary Four Cuts

![Plates]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dussack_A.png)

These can be performed from both the right and the left. These can also be performed with: [long edge, short edge]

1. Vertical Cut (the Scalp line, AE, EA)
2. Downward diagonal (the Wrath line, BF, HD)
3. Middle line (the Middenhau line, CG, GC)
4. Upward diagonal (the Low cut line, DH, FB)

**Mid Point**: The intersection of all the above lines is just below the chin, centering at where the neck meets the body. This is the platonic idea for the location of the attacks. 

For simultaneous attacks, you must attack to the lines above otherwise you will not parry nor be protected. If you attack in the before, you can cut as you please to any target.

#### Drills

* Perform these exclusively with the long edge
* Then perform these exclusively with short edge
* Then mix them up.

Start simple, add complexity, slowly up the ante till understanding.

##### Drill 1

 *Aim*: Cut through the line from [right, left], first halfway to langort, then all the way through with cut after cut.

**1A**: For *line* in [Vertical, Downward, Middle, Upward] perform *cut* in [High, Wrath, Middle, Low]:

* Stand in Stier with left foot forward.
* Passing step and *cut* to langort at *Mid Point*.
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Go to left Bogen and gather your feet to your forward foot: Drop foible of blade to the left while bringing the hilt up to hang around your head. As you do this, bring your rear foot to your forward foot.
	* Step forward (right) and *cut* *line* to *Mid Point* by bringing the blade back around your head
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Go to left Bogen and gather to your rear foot
	* Step back (left) and *cut* *line* to *Mid Point* as above

```
emphasis: Learn to hold off your cuts, so that you can turn a cut to a parry. Ie simultaneous cuts.
```
**1B**: Do *1A* where you *cut* entirely through the *line* all the way to the left, turning your body towards your left such that the dussack flows past you on the left.

*For an unterhau*: Cut along the upward line through your opponent's face, then turn hand so that the thumb points to the left and place the short edge of your blade on your left shoulder.

```
emphasis: Learning to send away and to cut away your opponents cuts by cutting entirely through.
```

##### Drill 2

*Aim*: How to drive the cuts through one line opposite one another

For *line* in [Vertical, Downward, Middle] perform *cut* in [High, Wrath, Middle]:

* Stand right foot forward with feet close together
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Step (right) and *cut* through the *line* with arm extended such that the dussack comes back up in left *Stier* in a shooting (pops back up) manner and gather your feet forward.
	* Step (right) and *cut* back in reverse along the *line* with your long edge, forcefully, and then go back over and around your head into right *Stier*, and gather your feet forward.

*For low cut*: Don't allow it to shoot up, rather let it go into left wrath or lie on your shoulder. Drive the attack.

```
emphasis: Learning to strike away the opponent's weapon
```

##### Drill 3

Deception and how to pull cuts away and change them into different ones.

For *line* in [Vertical, Downward, Middle, Upward] with *direction* in [right, left] with *cut* in [High, Wrath, Middle, Low]:

* Stand in *Wacth* with right foot forward (any stance and any foot is applicable)
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Step and *cut* from the *direction* with extended arm and long edge on *line*.
	* Watch for parry by opponent. As he does parry, before letting blades meet, pull blade back and cut the reverse of the *direction* on the same *line*

```
emphasis: This is the start of all cunning and trickery
```

##### Drill 4

How to change cuts into different ones

This focuses on just three lines: [Downward, Middle, Upward]. Change between them in a fluid motion.

**Base Case**: 
Repeat:

* Cut from right on the downward line.
* Cut from left on middle line.
* Cut from right on the upward line
* Cut from left on the upward line
* Cut from right on the middle line
* Cut from left on the downward line

```
emphasis: the changing of cuts happens on the diagonals and horizontal cuts.
emphasis: pattern: [diag, middle, diag]*
```

**Example with Six Cuts**: 

Always use right foot forward step. (with a gather of the rear)

Repeat switfly:

* Step and Wrath cut on BF (right to left) to opponent
* Cut Middle from left to right
* Cut strong Low from right to left such that at the end of the cut the dussack hangs behind left shoulder
* Cut strong Low from left to right
* Cut Middle from right to left
* Broad Step and Cut Scalp from above

*Optional*: Add steps to the cuts

**Changing the Cross by means of the Middle Cut**:

Keep right foot forward.

Repeat:

* Repeat for direction in [right, left]:
	* Cut Wrath from *direction*
	* Cut Wrath from opposite *direction*
	* Cut Middle from *direction* into middle guard
* Cut Middle from side you ended up on

*Optional*: Add steps to the cuts

**A Cross Change**:

Stand right foot forward.

* Take a broad step forward and cut Wrath from right
* Repeat:
	* Cut short edge Low cut from left towards right shoulder
	* Bring blade above head and cut Wrath from left such that point is towards the ground on right side.
	* Cut short edge Low cut from right towards left shoulder
	* Bring blade above head and cut Wrath from right.

*Optional*: Add steps to the cuts

```
emphasis: Learning how to change from one cut to another
```

### The Secondary Cuts

#### The Plunge Cut [Sturtzhauw]

This is exectuted with the High or Wrath Cuts.

### Pair Exercises

#### Cut Examples

**activity U2**: cut in an x pattern with [long, short] edge

**activity U3**: cut short then long from the same side before changing sides

```
emphasis: Footwork, rotate on the spot, have feet move, TWISTING
emphasis: be big and exaggerated
```

#### Cut to block to cut

**activity U4**: Advancing: left foot forward, in stier, thrust forward as far as possible without stepping while twisting leading foot and extending fully, then step forward (right) and cut from the right into langort. (Then gather feet (bring left to meet right) with dussack covering head, then cut again.)+ 

**activity U5**: Retreating: (cut into schnitt and step back with back foot, gather leading foot backwards to rear foot and go to bogen)+. Think of this as the retreat of U4

**activity U6**: U4 till mid point, U5 back to starting position.

**activity U7**: Pair drill: One performs U4, the other U5. Blades should meet at bogen and cut respectively.

*Optional*: U7 but change over when instructor calls switch instead of waiting till end of space

#### Flow: Parry Riposte

```
emphasis: Keep a constant rhythm to maintain a beat
```

**activity U8**: (attack to the same side) A cuts at B, B parries with bogen, B cuts at A, A parries with bogen. repeat in a flow.

*Once comfortable*: Start shifting weight backwards and forwards with the strikes, backward blocks, forward strikes

*Once comfortable*: when blocking bring front foot back to back foot, when striking step forward

*Once comfortable*: attack from left and right hand side. 

```
emphasis: when striking power comes from pulling back around the head. That doubles up as a good defense.
```

**activity U9**: U8 but now strike away attacks (short) instead of parrying them. Start with just one peron using strikes instead of parries while the other keeps using parries.

Optional: use both long and short edges for striking aside

**activity U10**: A cuts from below to above in a constant beat on left and right, B cuts into the sword as a strike over, aiming to cross blades.

#### Play: Attack Parry riposte

**activity U11**: B cuts from the right at A, A blocks using bogen, counter attacks at B with a cut from the right (oberhau), B strikes A's blade away with a short edge krophau from belowish (functionally the blade is in the same area  in general that the bind was made) and cuts (oberhau) at A

```
emphasis: From the weapon to the body and from the body to the weapon
emphasis: Go from strike to thrust and thrust to strike
```

Optional: Attack from left

Optional: turn into a flow drill

#### Play: Grab and Control

Both: B in eber, A cut to B oberhauw right, B blocks in stier (blade crosses A's with arm forarm behind blade) thumb down.

**activity U12**: *Fobile opening*. Grab blade and rotate to left and take blade and push tip forward while rotating wrist such that thumb points to the right so that the blade is on A's neck. [slice, cut, stab, etc]

**activity U13**: *Forte opening*. Grab blade and push it out to the left (A's outside, B's inside) such that left thumb up and [cut, pommel, stab, slice] to A head, or any open target.

Optional: on Forte opening, push A's blade back and to the left.

**activity U14**: *Counter Play A* for [U13, U14], A attacks, B blocks to prep for [U13, U14], A grabs B's sword hand with A's left hand, A pushs B's hand down while stepping forward (Left foot) and then out with right foot, A also takes blade to swing short edge on B's head.

*Optional*: thrust instead of strike

*Counter play B*: A grabs B's left arm and pulls it in front of B's body in the way of the sword while performing a low cut of the dussack short edge to the back of B's left ear (head) with weight on front foot.

## Post Thoughts

A good martial artist does not become tense, but ready. Not thinking, yet not dreaming. Ready for whatever may come. When the opponent expands, I contract; and when he contracts, I expand. And when there is an opportunity, “I” do not hit, “it” hits all by itself. - Bruce Lee
