## Class Schedule

The Monday evening practice is the core club program, which remains essentially recreational. It includes beginners in both Fencing and HEMA. Members can participate in both or either of the two club days; with the added proviso that the Tuesday HEMA program is of an advanced nature and hence members need to qualify by completing an Intro course first.

A HEMA Intro course typical runs from an Open Day for two months and culminates in a HEMA league event where you can test the skills you have been working on.

Individual lessons can be arranged with either David or Glenda on either day, if available.
