### Digression: The Nature of Stances and guards

Guards are not guards. They are more like stances. They don't really protect much. *Example* Tag or Ox, part is protected and most is not. Stances are positions you *pass through* or *end up in*. They are connected to the movements.

Therefore always shift between guards. Same as Dagger and Dusack.

*Aim*: Constantly be moving, Looking for position/advantage. 

These are the places you end up in when you [cut, thrust, deflect, are deflected]. Decide on the way to the guard (the "crossroads") what you are going to do. Once you get into your stance you then act on what you decided to do.

*Meyer*: You stay in guard for a blink of an eye.

Therefore you move into position to see the reaction and immediately make new plans given that information.

Grips: Start in hammer. As you cut it goes to V. With thumb on the back of the hilt. Reasoning is: with hammer, it prevents the full strike, the V allows the complete extention of the swing. 

```
emphasis: allows the strike to flow.
```

### The Guards and Cutting through them

```
emphasis: A cut is a move from one guard to another, and at each point, you can then choose to continue the flow or change into a new strike.
```

Cycle through these in order:

Start left foot forward: (Guards on the left)

**Tag**: Hands above head, with blade pointing backwards. (to upwards)

step right foot forward.

**Langort**: blade directly in front at full extention

**Olber**: blade down in front at 45 degrees to ground on your left

**Wechsel**: blade down to the left pointing towards the ground (think straight down), right hand in front, hanging down on left side of right leg. long edge away from opponent

**Nebenhut**: long edge towards opponent, blade pointing backwardsd 45 degrees towards the ground, leaning weight on back leg.

**Einhorn**: short edge towards ground, 45 degrees up towards the sky facing towards opponent. hands above head.

**Ochs**: point directly towards opponent, hands above head, cross forward.

Step forward passing (Guards on the right)

**Langort**: thrust into langort.

**Wechsel**: right wechsel as above

**Nebenhut**: right nebenhut as above

**Einhorn**: right einhorn as above

**Ochs**: right ochs as above

**Hangetort**: from ochs, drop the tip to be 45 degress towards the ground.

Step back passing

**Pflug**: left foot forward, arms straigh and down in front of you at 40 degrees angle with the flat of the blade facing the line of attack (right). and thumb on the back of the flat. (reverse for other side)

**Eisenport**: push forward pflug

```
emphasis: view the combination of pflug, ochs, eisenport, schlussel as a cone with which you defend yourself.
emphasis: The point must always be towards your opponents midpoint.
```

Last guards:

**Zornhut**: left foot forward, wieght on right leg, blade resting on right shoulder, with the tip pointing downwards.

**Schlussel**: start in ochs, drop the cross into the crook of the forward elbow.

**Activity L1**: Work through the above guards in order shown slowly.

*Follow on*: work through [pflug, ochs, eisenport, schlussel] in pairs moving for advantage and position.

**Activity L2**: Stand in place, switch from left foot forward to right and back again, oberhut long edge from both sides. [Wrath cuts].

*Follow on*: Gradually increase the speed while reducing the steps. ie: cut faster to the point of doing two cuts in a single step.

```
emphasis: keep moving your feet
emphasis: make sure to use the v grip when cutting and feel the edge alignment.
```

**Activity L3**: Stand in place as L2 and cut long edge unterhauw (nebenhut, langort, ochs, einhorn) 

*Follow on*: go from unter to ober

**Activity L4**: Safe behind a sword, A defends with pflug, B attacks with ober and unter.

### Short edge to long edge

**Activity L5**: Stand in place exercise like L3, start left foot forward, Short cut from right to left, long edge cut from right to left and step. repeat.

*In depth*: Left Ochs, Hangetort (right foot forward), cut around your head by bring the blade back on the right and cut left to right into langort and step, right weschel, right nebenhut, right einhorn, right ochs, right hangetort. Repeat. 

*Follow on*: Do this from bellow.

```
emphasis: its all about the flow, from stance to stance
```

**Activity L6**: Paired Exercise, B left foot forward, A cuts Oberhauw at B, B short edge cuts the weapon away while first step of right foot to the front and out, then long edge cut and step left behind right.

B starts in [Ochs, Einhorn, Wacht, Tag]. Basically doing a Krumphauw followed by [zornhauw, shieldhauw].

*Follow on*: Same exercise from below, A still attacks from above. 

*Follow on*: Apply from both sides against the same attack, experiment to understand application.

**Activity L7**: A performs left right ober attacks, B does short edge long edge.

**Follow on**: One step out of phase, both short long each other, going for the weapon and the body.

### Krumphauw

**Activity L8**: crooked strike from dusack with two hands, cut in a figure of 8, long edge, short edge. Crossing and uncrossing the arms. Must keep the thumb on the shield of the blade.

*Principle*: Cut with an edge, then follow up with the other. IE: Short edge into long, long into short.

*Follow on*: use short edge from right hand side, instead of long edge from right hand side.

```
emphasis: you are cutting from your right side, aiming to have the tip of the blade hit to your opponent on their right shoulder, (on your left side)
```

*Follow on*: Pair up, A obers, B krumphs. 

```
emphasis: Must place hands out to the side.
emphasis: Must cross over the line between A and B, then move both hands to the other side.
```

**Activity L9** Flow drill, A obers, B krumphs. For A strike and then let blade be deflected down to the side of hit then pull blade back around head for another strike.

**Activity L10**: Flow drill, both perform krumphauw against each other however just out of phase, so one long edges into a short, etc
