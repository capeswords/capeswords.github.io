## HEMA in South Africa

The South African community is a small but growing and vibrant group of individuals. Due to the relatively new nature of the sport and the sheer distances involved in South Africa, there are a limited set of clubs and groups in the medieval fighting circles. Below is a partial list of those clubs active in the community.
