## General approach to Dussack

1. Do not wait in the guards. Aim to attack as quickly as possible in the Before. As it is isn't always possible to be first, always make sure to place yourself in a posture/position/guard such that the opponent can not attack you without incurring damage to himself.

2. All attacks are a flow from one guard to another.

3. Learn the guards and the attacks from those guards, so as to learn what techniques and attacks are possible from the opponent. From this you can deduce the opponents strategy.

4. Given you can deduce his strategy from a guard, never remain static in a guard. Always change, look for position/advantage. This hides your intent and adds to the challenge of attacking you.

## How to hold the Dussack

1. Normal Hammer Grip. 

2. Extended Thumb grip. Place the thumb of the sword hand along the back of the handle. This should add to better control.

3. Side Grip. Thumb by the nargel

--

## Stances

This is a brief summary of the available stances/postures.

```
emphasis: these are NOT stationary guards, keep moving between them
emphasis: DO NOT stand still in these guards
emphasis: it is all in the movements
```

* *wacht*: right foot forward, both hands above the head, right arm infront of left, dussack pointing backwards
* *schnitt*: right arm forward and slightly bent, blade held forward with the blade pointing to the head of opponent, blade facing as per cut from above head
* *langort*: blade point directly at opponent, at the longest extention of the sword tip to enemy.
* *bastey*: blade pointing 45 degrees down to the ground, towards the opponent
* *wechselhut*: blade pointing down to the ground, blade edge away from opponent, perpendicular
* *nebenhut*: wechselhut with blade edge to opponent. blade pointing to the ground 45 degrees away from the opponent

**Cut 1**: (wacht, schnitt, langort, bastey, wechselhut, nebenhut) on [left, right] side of the body. looks like a J. 

* *bogen* [bow]: cut forward to schnitt from wacht, then rotate wrist [left, right] so blade is pointing down. (can point anywhere from 45 degrees down to straight down) 
 *einhorn*: blade facing the left side pointing upwards at 45 degrees, right hand by face. #ThurstingGuard
 *stier*: einhorn but with point to opponent, blade edge up, and left hand behind the blade to support it. #ThurstingGuard
 *eber* [boar]: right hand by right hip, blade parallel to floor point at oppoenent, left hand protecting the heart. #ThurstingGuard
 *zornhut*: left foot forward, lean back away from opponent onto the right foot, blade on the back by right shoulder. #ThurstingGuard
* *middenhut*: [right side]:left foot forward, weight on right, hand at shoulder height, blade hanging. reverse for left side.

o Thrust: go from a #ThurstingGuard to langort

**Cut 2**: (right middenhut, schnitt, left middenhut, bastey)

**activity U1**: while facing an opponent move between the guards, constantly changing and repositioning. Similar to D2.

## The Primary Four Cuts

![Plates]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dussack_A.png)

These can be performed from both the right and the left. These can also be performed with: [long edge, short edge]

1. Vertical Cut (the Scalp line, AE, EA)
2. Downward diagonal (the Wrath line, BF, HD)
3. Middle line (the Middenhau line, CG, GC)
4. Upward diagonal (the Low cut line, DH, FB)

**Mid Point**: The intersection of all the above lines is just below the chin, centering at where the neck meets the body. This is the platonic idea for the location of the attacks. 

For simultaneous attacks, you must attack to the lines above otherwise you will not parry nor be protected. If you attack in the before, you can cut as you please to any target.

### Drills

* Perform these exclusively with the long edge
* Then perform these exclusively with short edge
* Then mix them up.

Start simple, add complexity, slowly up the ante till understanding.

#### Drill 1

 *Aim*: Cut through the line from [right, left], first halfway to langort, then all the way through with cut after cut.

**1A**: For *line* in [Vertical, Downward, Middle, Upward] perform *cut* in [High, Wrath, Middle, Low]:

* Stand in Stier with left foot forward.
* Passing step and *cut* to langort at *Mid Point*.
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Go to left Bogen and gather your feet to your forward foot: Drop foible of blade to the left while bringing the hilt up to hang around your head. As you do this, bring your rear foot to your forward foot.
	* Step forward (right) and *cut* *line* to *Mid Point* by bringing the blade back around your head
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Go to left Bogen and gather to your rear foot
	* Step back (left) and *cut* *line* to *Mid Point* as above

```
emphasis: Learn to hold off your cuts, so that you can turn a cut to a parry. Ie simultaneous cuts.
```
**1B**: Do *1A* where you *cut* entirely through the *line* all the way to the left, turning your body towards your left such that the dussack flows past you on the left.

*For an unterhau*: Cut along the upward line through your opponent's face, then turn hand so that the thumb points to the left and place the short edge of your blade on your left shoulder.

```
emphasis: Learning to send away and to cut away your opponents cuts by cutting entirely through.
```

#### Drill 2

*Aim*: How to drive the cuts through one line opposite one another

For *line* in [Vertical, Downward, Middle] perform *cut* in [High, Wrath, Middle]:

* Stand right foot forward with feet close together
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Step (right) and *cut* through the *line* with arm extended such that the dussack comes back up in left *Stier* in a shooting (pops back up) manner and gather your feet forward.
	* Step (right) and *cut* back in reverse along the *line* with your long edge, forcefully, and then go back over and around your head into right *Stier*, and gather your feet forward.

*For low cut*: Don't allow it to shoot up, rather let it go into left wrath or lie on your shoulder. Drive the attack.

```
emphasis: Learning to strike away the opponent's weapon
```

#### Drill 3

Deception and how to pull cuts away and change them into different ones.

For *line* in [Vertical, Downward, Middle, Upward] with *direction* in [right, left] with *cut* in [High, Wrath, Middle, Low]:

* Stand in *Wacth* with right foot forward (any stance and any foot is applicable)
* Repeat 3 (or x) times:
	* Step and *cut* from the *direction* with extended arm and long edge on *line*.
	* Watch for parry by opponent. As he does parry, before letting blades meet, pull blade back and cut the reverse of the *direction* on the same *line*

```
emphasis: This is the start of all cunning and trickery
```

#### Drill 4

How to change cuts into different ones

This focuses on just three lines: [Downward, Middle, Upward]. Change between them in a fluid motion.

**Base Case**: 
Repeat:

* Cut from right on the downward line.
* Cut from left on middle line.
* Cut from right on the upward line
* Cut from left on the upward line
* Cut from right on the middle line
* Cut from left on the downward line

```
emphasis: the changing of cuts happens on the diagonals and horizontal cuts.
emphasis: pattern: [diag, middle, diag]*
```

**Example with Six Cuts**: 

Always use right foot forward step. (with a gather of the rear)

Repeat switfly:

* Step and Wrath cut on BF (right to left) to opponent
* Cut Middle from left to right
* Cut strong Low from right to left such that at the end of the cut the dussack hangs behind left shoulder
* Cut strong Low from left to right
* Cut Middle from right to left
* Broad Step and Cut Scalp from above

*Optional*: Add steps to the cuts

**Changing the Cross by means of the Middle Cut**:

Keep right foot forward.

Repeat:

* Repeat for direction in [right, left]:
	* Cut Wrath from *direction*
	* Cut Wrath from opposite *direction*
	* Cut Middle from *direction* into middle guard
* Cut Middle from side you ended up on

*Optional*: Add steps to the cuts

**A Cross Change**:

Stand right foot forward.

* Take a broad step forward and cut Wrath from right
* Repeat:
	* Cut short edge Low cut from left towards right shoulder
	* Bring blade above head and cut Wrath from left such that point is towards the ground on right side.
	* Cut short edge Low cut from right towards left shoulder
	* Bring blade above head and cut Wrath from right.

*Optional*: Add steps to the cuts

```
emphasis: Learning how to change from one cut to another
```

## The Secondary Cuts

### The Plunge Cut [Sturtzhauw]

This is exectuted with the High or Wrath Cut and mostly in the *Onset*. 

Start left foot forward; For cut in [High, Wrath];

Repeat:

* step and *cut* long from the right all the way through so that the blade shoots back up similar to stier except that: tip of blade points to opponent AND the tip is *thrusted* forward towards the opponent, short edge down
* go to right bogen, bring hilt up around head, gather rear foot forward
* step and *cut* long from the left all the way through such that blades shoots back up short edge down and thrusted forward as above
* go to left bogen, bring hilt up around head, gather rear foot


### Crooked Cut [Krumphauw]

* Turn grip around so that the short edge is going forward in the cut (You put your thumb on the edge and turn the blade sideways),
* cut from above or below with the short edge at an angle (across the line between you and your opponent) as you have the opening to do so.

### Short Cut [Kurtzhauw]

Exectuted in the *Onset* when the opponent plans to cut from above.

* As he moves his blade to go above, pull weapon to left shoulder. 
* Cut at the same time with the short edge across over his arm and through his face, palm staying upwards in the attack

*Optional*: cut to the sides under the opponents weapon

### Constrainer Cut [Zwingerhauw]

This is done in two ways. First:

* In left *middenhut*
* Cut at opponent's cut with the long edge

Second:

* Right foot forward in *schnitt* (Slice/Straight Parry)
* Opponent attacks to your left with high cuts, 
* drop your tip and pull hilt to left under his dusack. Do no let blades hit
* cut quickly over his right arm at his head whilst his blade is still falling
* after cut, pull your head away from him under your blade while parrying and lean away.

### Roarer Cut [Brummerhauw]

If done right this cut will make a sound (hence the name). Start right foot forward.

* Attack opponent so that they parry high
* turn grip so that dusack is crooked,
* pull hilt around head with hanging dusack
* cut at the forearm from the right with short edge from below and step right foot to the left
* go to right bogen

### Waker Cut [WeckerHauw]

Excute this in the *Onset*

* Cut a High cut powerfully
* if he parries, then as soon as blades meet turn into a thrust at his face (rotate wrist to the left 180 degrees)
* if he goes up then with a crooked edge cut upwards through his arm. (keeping wrist in general area, swing sword up and around to perform upwards cut.

### Rose Cut

Force a parry, skip the parry and strike from the other side

* Opponent stands in bogen
* Attack opponent from above to the head, do not let the blades connect
* Instead go around the to the outside (right) of the opponent and come in a cicle with the blade so that you have gone around his dusack and are on the left of it.
* cut at his face

### Danger Cut [Gefehrauw]

Start in the *Onset*

* Watch the Opponent
* As soon as they bring the blade up to make a strike
* Cut at opponent from above at face or chest while his dusack is still being raised

*Caution*: This is a dangerous cut, hence the name.

### Anger cut [Entrusthauw]

aka: Armour Cut.

Version 1:

* As opponent prepares to perform a High cut
* Quickly pull the blade back and around your head on the left and cut across and against his blade at a slight upwards angle. 
* Aim to catch his dusack with the long edge and your dusack horizontal pointing to the side so that your dusack is between you and your opponent 

Version 2: 

* Stand in eber with Left foot forward, 
* As he cuts bring both arms up such that the back of the dusack lies on your left arm and spring forward

* Perform Entrusthauw
* As blades meet, turn short edge inward in a flick into opponent face.
* As soon as flick lands, twist back to long edge inwards
* step well around to the right and pull blade back around head and cut to face

### Flicking Cut [Schnellhauw]

* Stand in bogen, use when opponent will not initiate a cut
* pull into Watch, but do not go to cut from above, instead cut with long edge upwards from below in a flick
* turn dusack to put short edge on left shoulder
* cut a Defense Stroke from the left through the opponents face. either over or under the arm.

*Optional*: If opponent is in bogen: flick with short edge over his dusack at his head.

## Pair Exercises

### Cut Examples

**activity U2**: cut in an x pattern with [long, short] edge

**activity U3**: cut short then long from the same side before changing sides

```
emphasis: Footwork, rotate on the spot, have feet move, TWISTING
emphasis: be big and exaggerated
```

--

### Cut to block to cut

**activity U4**: Advancing: left foot forward, in stier, thrust forward as far as possible without stepping while twisting leading foot and extending fully, then step forward (right) and cut from the right into langort. (Then gather feet (bring left to meet right) with dussack covering head, then cut again.)+ 

**activity U5**: Retreating: (cut into schnitt and step back with back foot, gather leading foot backwards to rear foot and go to bogen)+. Think of this as the retreat of U4

**activity U6**: U4 till mid point, U5 back to starting position.

**activity U7**: Pair drill: One performs U4, the other U5. Blades should meet at bogen and cut respectively.

*Optional*: U7 but change over when instructor calls switch instead of waiting till end of space

--

### Flow: Parry Riposte

```
emphasis: Keep a constant rhythm to maintain a beat
```

**activity U8**: (attack to the same side) A cuts at B, B parries with bogen, B cuts at A, A parries with bogen. repeat in a flow.

*Once comfortable*: Start shifting weight backwards and forwards with the strikes, backward blocks, forward strikes

*Once comfortable*: when blocking bring front foot back to back foot, when striking step forward

*Once comfortable*: attack from left and right hand side. 

```
emphasis: when striking power comes from pulling back around the head. That doubles up as a good defense.
```

**activity U9**: U8 but now strike away attacks (short) instead of parrying them. Start with just one peron using strikes instead of parries while the other keeps using parries.

Optional: use both long and short edges for striking aside

**activity U10**: A cuts from below to above in a constant beat on left and right, B cuts into the sword as a strike over, aiming to cross blades.

--

### Play: Attack Parry riposte

**activity U11**: B cuts from the right at A, A blocks using bogen, counter attacks at B with a cut from the right (oberhau), B strikes A's blade away with a short edge krophau from belowish (functionally the blade is in the same area  in general that the bind was made) and cuts (oberhau) at A

```
emphasis: From the weapon to the body and from the body to the weapon
emphasis: Go from strike to thrust and thrust to strike
```

Optional: Attack from left

Optional: turn into a flow drill

--

### Play: Grab and Control

Both: B in eber, A cut to B oberhauw right, B blocks in stier (blade crosses A's with arm forarm behind blade) thumb down.

**activity U12**: *Fobile opening*. Grab blade and rotate to left and take blade and push tip forward while rotating wrist such that thumb points to the right so that the blade is on A's neck. [slice, cut, stab, etc]

**activity U13**: *Forte opening*. Grab blade and push it out to the left (A's outside, B's inside) such that left thumb up and [cut, pommel, stab, slice] to A head, or any open target.

Optional: on Forte opening, push A's blade back and to the left.

**activity U14**: *Counter Play A* for [U13, U14], A attacks, B blocks to prep for [U13, U14], A grabs B's sword hand with A's left hand, A pushs B's hand down while stepping forward (Left foot) and then out with right foot, A also takes blade to swing short edge on B's head.

*Optional*: thrust instead of strike

*Counter play B*: A grabs B's left arm and pulls it in front of B's body in the way of the sword while performing a low cut of the dussack short edge to the back of B's left ear (head) with weight on front foot.
