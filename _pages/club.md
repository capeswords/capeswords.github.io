We are a Sports Fencing and Historical European Martial Arts club.

On the sports fencing side we make use of all three weapons (foil, sabre, épée) to some degree and our focus is on being a place where the love and joy of fencing can flourish with out the need and requirement to be in a high competitive environment. Our focus is on adults whom still enjoy the sport and want to find a place continue pursuing their passion.

On the Historical European Martial Arts side we fight with longswords, dusacks, rapiers, halberds, quarterstaffs and many more. We tend to focus on a number of traditions:

* The Liechtenauer German tradition of the 16 hundreds, specifically the teachings of Joachim Meyer.
* The French traditions from the late 18 and early 19 hundreds, specifically Giradi and Angelo
* The Hungarian Highland tradion of saber and single stick.

His involvement in coaching in South Africa goes back to assisting at Bishops in the late 80's. Thereafter, he was instrumental in establishing a fencing club at Rondebosch Boys High in the early 90's, from which he moved to Fish Hoek Senior High School in 1994. At about this time, his night manager position in a hotel, enabled him to spend his daytime hours coaching either at a school, or doing development work in the New Crossroads township.

Almost 3 years was then spent in the Netherlands. Here, whilst continuing being an ordinary fencer at a Salle, he was "apprenticed" by a fencing master in Amsterdam. Two years were spent learning how to make fencing work in schools, and a model was developed how to apply it in South Africa. The name of that fencing school, from which so much was learnt, was "En Garde".

On arrival back in South Africa, a club was established in Fish Hoek, and for a year he continued with a full-time job. At the beginning of 1999, he took the plunge and decided to follow his passion for the sport. En Garde was born, and initially it was based at Fish Hoek, and looked at really establishing a foothold in this area. This has expanded over the years to include four junior schools, Bishops college, a training club and an adult evening group which became Table Mountain Fencing and HEMA.

### Glenda Pieters

At age 16 Glenda won the S.A Junior Championships and 3 months later, an International Under 18 competition in Israel - the first and only South African fencer to win an international gold medal ever.  She has participated in other Commonwealth Games and World Championships.

She then coached school children in Athlone who excelled beyond their wildest dreams. They qualified and participated in World Championships, Commonwealth Games and the Olympics Through their achievements, they won scholarships to attend Bishops, St. Georges Grammar school and UCT. They made an impact in the community where they became good role models and proved that they could achieve goals that seemed unreachable. Today, she coaches adults fencing in a holistic way where one releases stress, exercises the mind & body and has fun.

Before I discover HEMA, there was a sword shaped gap in my universe. My mother
read me the knightly romances in the cradle and I have merrily played with anything remotely sword shaped whenever possible since.

After a little judo in primary school and a disappointing brush with Kenjitsu
lead me into the arms of Glenda Pieters and sports fencing. Seeing my love of
sabre, Glenda selflessly referred me to David Wagenvelt who nurtured my
passion and showed me the first codex i had ever seen. We shared a dream, and
so it was that David, his contemporary and lifelong friend Michael Beardwood
and I resurrected HEMA in Cape Town.

We soon formed a core group and in recent years have grown fast. I am proud to
say that we have and still do host tournaments and workshops. I have attended
a workshops by Bob Brooks of Hotspur HEMA, Roger Norling and several by Prof,
James Roberts of MACS in Pretoria and President of HEMA South Africa, all of
whom I number amongst my friends. I have taught elementary boxing, Meyer,
Hector-Meyer, Fiore and Merozzo wrestling and dagger, taught and completed the
south atlantic longsword syllabus and explored in subsequent lessons aspects of
Wittenwiller, Ringeck and doebringer's longsword work. I have dabbled in
hector-meye's halberd and Talhoffers duelling shield and sword.

I work as a personal trainer and sports masseuse. I am 27 and I have no idea
what my future holds but so long as I hold my lady's love, the esteem of my
brothers and sisters in arms and a good sword the future looks bright.
