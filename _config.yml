# if you use this repo's `ruby compose.rb` script to initiate new posts, put the
# command to invoke your editor here. (I didn't spend time dealing with spaces
# and full paths of the various OSes in compose.rb. For my Windows
# environment, I just put a subl.cmd file in my PATH that points to the full
# path to Sublime's subl.exe.) Also, put your most common post extension.
